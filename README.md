Plan: 20 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  + amazon_linux_ami = "ami-06b21ccaeff8cd686"
  + ubuntu_ami       = "ami-0cad6ee50670e3d0e"
  + ubuntu_public_ip = (known after apply)


Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run
"terraform apply" now.
